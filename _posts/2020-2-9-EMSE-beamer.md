title: Latex Beamer for EMSE
---

Here there are some templates to help the work with latex through beamer for presentation, CV template and letter.

The presentation is a École des Mines de Saint-Étienne Latex template. This is not a STY file for beamer but is base on, so you must call the EMSE_beamer.tex file explicitly from your TEX file for presentations.
