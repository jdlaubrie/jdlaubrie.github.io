This is the GitHub repository used to create a simple academic/personal website.

This website is heavily based on jekyll-now theme for GitHub pages, [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Thanks for the template!

However I have learned a lot from Broman's website, there are some tutorials and his simply css template helped me to understand how to work with stylesheets. [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org); thanks Karl Broman!
