Dr. Joan D. Laubrie is a scientist in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering at Ri.MED Foundation. Joan specializes on Computational Mechanics applied to bioengineering problems. He enjoys learn new skills and enhance them by solving challenging engineering problems. In his free time, Joan likes to practice different sports, such as: hiking, climbing, skiing, swimming and long bike rides on hilly country roads.

Joan received his MS in Mechanical Engineering from the “Universidad de Santiago” (Chile) in 2016. After one year of working as Project Engineer in DICTUC (Chile) and teaching fellow at the “Universidad de Santiago” and “Pontificia Universidad Católica” (Chile), he started doctoral studies at “Écoles des Mines de Saint-Étienne” (France) where he earned the PhD in 2021. Right after, he joined the Ri.MED Foundation to work on the computational aspects of Cardiovascular Tissue. 

#### Scientific Activity
Joan’s activities focus on the design of a prosthetic mitral valve through the use of numerical methods. Additionally, he designs the custom devices to perform some of the experimental tasks crucial for successfully fabricating the mitral valve scaffolds. For the mentioned activities, it is necessary to handle a collection of skills on finite-element analysis, finite-volume methods, computer-aided design, coding (in different languages: Python, Julia, Fortran, C++), mechanical modelling and testing.
