#### [A new finite‐element shell model for arterial growth and remodeling after stent implantationcreased eye contact on feeding portions](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cnm.3282)

The goal of this paper is to study computationally how blood vessels adapt when they are exposed to a mechanobiological insult, namely, a sudden change of their biomechanical conditions such as proteolytic injuries or implantation. Adaptation occurs through growth and remodeling (G&R), consisting of mass production or removal of structural proteins, such as collagen, until restoring the initial homeostatic biomechanical conditions. In some circumstances, the initial conditions can never be recovered, and arteries evolve towards unstable pathological conditions, such as aneurysms, which are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, computational predictions of G&R under different circumstances can be helpful in understanding fundamentally how arterial pathologies progress. For that, we have developed a low‐cost open‐source finite‐element 2D axisymmetric shell model (FEM) of the arterial wall. The constitutive equations for static equilibrium used to model the stress‐strain behavior and the G&R response are expressed within the homogenized constrained mixture theory. The originality is to integrate the layer‐specific behavior of both arterial layers (media and adventitia) into the model. Considering different mechanobiological insults, our results show that the resulting arterial dilatation is strongly correlated with the media thickness. The adaptation to stent implantation is particularly interesting. For large stent oversizing ratios, the artery cannot recover from the mechanobiological insult and dilates forever, whereas dilatation stabilizes after a transient period for more moderate oversizing ratios. We also show that stent implantation induces a different response in an aneurysm or in a healthy artery, the latter yielding more unstable G&R. Finally, our G&R model can efficiently predict, with very low computational cost, fundamental aspects of arterial adaptation induced by clinical procedures.
